# Vercel Deployment Issue Fix

## 🐛 Problem
The ETrainer backend was failing on Vercel with the following error:
```
Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, mkdir 'logs'
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The Winston logger was trying to create a `logs` directory and write log files in production mode, but Vercel's serverless environment has a read-only filesystem that doesn't allow directory creation.

## ✅ Solution
Modified `src/utils/logger.js` to:

1. **Import serverless detection**: Added import for `isServerless` from `src/configs/serverless.js`
2. **Conditional file logging**: Only create file transports when NOT in serverless environment
3. **Console logging maintained**: All log levels still work via console output

### Code Changes
```javascript
// Before
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  transports.push(/* file transports */);
}

// After  
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !isServerless) {
  transports.push(/* file transports */);
}
```

## 🧪 Testing
Created and ran a test script that simulates Vercel environment variables and confirmed:
- ✅ Logger imports without errors
- ✅ All log levels work (info, warn, error, debug)
- ✅ No file system operations attempted in serverless mode
- ✅ Console output still captures all logs

## 🚀 Deployment Status
- ✅ Fix committed to main branch
- ✅ Changes pushed to GitHub
- 🔄 Vercel should auto-deploy the fix

## 🔧 Environment Detection
The fix leverages existing serverless detection logic:
```javascript
const isServerless = process.env.VERCEL || process.env.NETLIFY || process.env.AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME;
```

## 📊 Impact
- **Before**: 500 errors on all requests due to logger initialization failure
- **After**: Normal operation with console-based logging in production
- **Local dev**: Unchanged - still creates log files when not in serverless mode
